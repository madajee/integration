                <h5>LEAD FEATURE</h5>
                <p>As a Lead to Cash Stakeholder, I would like to see that all the Leads that are qualified in our Marketing Application should be created in Salesforce Sales Cloud within an hour. I also require that when Sales Rep convert the lead to create account, contacts and opportunities, we should have an extensible Lead Conversion Engine that relies on standard Convert Lead feature of Sales Cloud. Mulesoft API Implementation Flows should allow us to build Conversion Engine with enterpise specific requirements, rules and processes that we can evolve as we scale and integrate within the realm of enterprise applications for our clients.  All these automation should be triggered through a Mulesoft API resource so that external calls to the Salesforce Lead Object from all internal and external applications should be unified and standardized through an API Layer.</p>
                <p>In the initial sprint, the acceptance criteria is to have a system level API application with Create Lead, Convert Lead and Delete Lead resources. Delete Lead is only for clean-up and should be protected with a special username / password if we are using basic auth or with a special scope if we are using token based auth schemes.</p>
                <p>In subsequent sprints, we will have to build process level API resources:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Automation to create leads should run every hour that will call on Create Lead system level resource.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Implement all the business rules in the Lead Conversion Engine that will call on Convert Lead system level resource.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Both automation should use common batch framework that we have to build and test as we integrate system level resources in process layer. We have different approaches and mule components that support Batch processing like Pub-Sub patterns, Mule Batch componenet with Asynchronous Parallel Processing, Parallel For Each so we have to apply fit for purpose analysis which can be backed with solution views, POCs and then use the one that gets approved in specific implementations.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h5>PRODUCT AND PRICEBOOK FEATURE</h5>
                <p>As a Senior Executive, I would like to mention that we sell both internationally and in US, so our Salesforce Admin has activated multiple currencies in Salesforce Org Admin has added <i>GBP - British Pound, EUR - Euro, JPY - Japanese Yen,SGD - Singapore Dollar </i> along with <i>USD - US Dollar</i> but the corporate currency is <i>USD - US Dollar</i>. Our product group creates and mantain product sheets to discuss product codes, pricing and other market level product configurations. I would like Automation team to pick up the product sheets on hourly schedule and create / and update products in the Product2 salesforce object and also create the associated pricebook entries in PricebookEntry salesforce object. The pricebook in Pricebook2 salesforce object are created and managed by the product architect manually through salesforce UI. Please take a note that Product Code is how we are going to uniquely idenfiy each product. 
                </p>
                <p>In the initial sprint, the acceptance criteria is to have a system level API implementation for Create Product, Retrieve Product and Delete Product resources.  Also we require Create., Retrieve and Delete for Pricebook Entry. Delete resources are required only for clean and should be protected with special access.</p>
                <p>In subsequent sprints, we will have to build process level API resources:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Automation to create products should run every hour and process level composition should call on both product and pricebook system level resources to setup the product code along with unit price in the salesforce org.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any Errors related to setup issues like missing Pricebook should sent an alert to product group immediately. If the same error is picked in the next hourly run, the notfication alert counter should be incremented as well.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
