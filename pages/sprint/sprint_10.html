                        <li><strong>Card-1: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Flow Builder Basics: One of ways we can automate tasks in salesforce and create point and click business automation is with Flow Builder. Flow Builder let you create both Interactive experiences with feature like Screen Ffows, Autolaunched flows and trigger based automation with features like Record Triggered, Schedule Triggered etc. Flow Builder has building blocks in form of Interaction Elements (Screen), Data Elements (Create Records, Get Records) and Logic Elements (Assignment, Decision). We create resources for things like variable and formulas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-2: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Data and Actions in Flows: As users work on record details and save them, we create trigger based flows which can be configured with record selection criteria and uses data elements like get records, create records. Data Elements like Get Records create variable which holds the data record values which can be aggregated to create records in related objects or actions like email, alerts and chatter post. We can reference the running user profile and fields values with global variables.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-3: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Flow Builder Logic: We build the logic in the flows with the decision elements to create multiple paths , use assignment operators to copy values in the variables, reuse common tasks with subflows and use permissions and global variables to create different outcomes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-4: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Record Triggered Flows: Create a <em>Review Opportunity with Account Owner</em> flow which is based on the opportunity object, and we have specified the conditions. It creates an email task for the account owner. It also has a scheduled path which gets trigger 3 days after the last modified date on the opportunity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-5: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Autolaunched and Scheduled Flows: Create a <em>Clone Closed Case</em> flow which is an autolaunched flow which clones the case and we trigger it with the action button on the case record.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-6: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Screen Flows: Complete a <em>Create Case for Contact</em> has the couple of screen elements that covers elements like textarea, toggle, radio and checkbox components. It then uses create record element to create a case record based on input data from screen components.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-7: </strong>Complete the following trail: Prepare for Salesforce Releases
                            <p>Salesforce Products and Platform Features are released in Spring, Summer and Winter releases. Customers generally explore release features with preview instances and promote customizations with non-preview instances in the release months. It is suggested to use filters to go through release notes and quick wins features are something easy to start for release managers.</p>
                            <p>Releases generally require a bit of planning with focused approach and it is recommended in trail: <em>Forward Plan; Roles, Responsibilities and Release Processes, Advance Tools</em></p>
                            <p>Understand the gaps in the released features and how it will be absorbed in the existing UIs and business processes. Depending upon complexity of the org salesforce environment and number of licensed users, you may need to define roles, responsibilities, apply testing approaches covering unit, integration, uat and create advance tooling in the form of spreadsheets with release matrixes or custom object to list new features. Release Teams also have to make sure adoption of new features.</p>
                            <p>Some of the Einstein and Platform features for Spring'25 are AI Assisted Agent Generation, Testing and Policy Center. Mulesoft Agentforce features include Topic Center, AI Chain Connector. Data Cloud can use Unstructed Audi and Video Content.</p>

                        <li><strong>Card-1: </strong>Complete the following trail step: Generative AI Basics. As we go through the readout about the capabilities and evolving technology ecosystem of generative AI, we get to know terms like  Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Model (LLM) which  uses machine learning alogirthms, neural networks, training with enormous datasets and accelerated computing chips to provide us with AI applications like ChatGPT. We understand that AI application are going to change the way we work and there is an emerging ecosystem computer hardware (Nvidia), hyperscalers / public cloud, foundation models (GPT, LLaMA), infrastructure optimization and training and applications like ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Einstein Copilot.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-2: </strong>Complete the following trail step: Discover Agentforce Agents. In this module, we understand that Agentforce allows salesforce customers to build AI agents that can be deployed across all salesforce products to drive customer success. Agents uses LLMs and business data in customer 360 and external data pulled in Data Cloud along with established guardrails to work as Service Agents, Sales Development Representative (SDR), Sales Coach, Merchandiser, Buyer Agent, Personal Shopper, Campaign Optimizer to, autonomously perform tasks and help customers alongside your reps and teams. Agentforce is build on salesforce reasoning engine and action framework that uses industry LLMs, platform components, knowledge articles, public data and guardrails configurations to augment customer salesforce experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-3: </strong>Complete the following trail step: Agentforce Service Agent. We can see that Agentforce service agent can be deployed with ease and can help service reps with 24/7 support, generating clear instructions and responses and providing smoother handoff in difficult conversations all while being grounded with trusted data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-4: </strong>Complete the following trail step: Configure an Agentforce Service Agent. You have to start by create an Agentforce playground and follow the instructions to enable the einstein features, publish a digital experience site of Coral Clouds, use agent builder to configure coral cloud service agent with topic, actions and instructions. You will then add the coral cloud agent to the coral cloud experience site using the Embedded Messaging component. You will test the deployed agent by accessing the site with published url using the email address and membership number provided in the module readout.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-5: </strong>Complete the following trail step: AI Strategy. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>As we start to read, we understand that  organization have to formulate an AI vision which will require an AI center of excellence, and participation from all business lines as AI is a tectonic shift which though in short term require pilot projects to realize quick wins with simpler use cases and improve on key business metrics but the long term goal is to create AI powered products and services that generate new business frontier. It is imperative that organization require a data strategy and data products to realize success on AI initiatives.</li>
                                <li>After the organization commits to AI frontier, the AI governance readout  explains that there are risks like inaccuracies and bias,  security breaches and the pace with AI revolution. Salesforce mentions responsible, accountable, transparent, empowering and inclusive as their AI trusting principles. AI governance org has to look into regulation landscape, monitor AI usage and manage the AI inventory along with mitigating several types of risks like data & privacy.</li>
                                <li>Now that we have guardians of AI initiatives established in organization with AI Governance Committe, the readout on usecases explain that AI has a potential to impact all business lines but it is imperative that we look at existing business processes and tech stacks, understand user behavior, market direction and encourage experimentation with internal resources. We then bucket use cases in quick wins, big bets, low hanging fruits and money pits. We build a decision framework to choose the AI projects and keep evolving AI strategy with launches, updates on AI inventory and get closer to AI transformations with Agent deployments.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Card-6: </strong>Complete the following trail step: AI + Data: Project Planning.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the AI strategy module, we have identified to streamline the check-in process for coral cloud and the key metric is to reduce the check-in along with maintaining or increasing customer satisfaction. We understand from AI project requires customer success manager, VP sponsor, security, legal and technical teams. We will then work on technical requirements that should cover AI tools, expertise, build vs buy option, address integration and data need. Salesforce offers Data Cloud, Einstein Copilot, prompt builder and flow to automate the creation of check-in record and sending a welcome email. Every project requires a plan and the readout tells us this pilot AI project should bucket tasks in plan, build and launch phase and timeline can be from 3-6 months.</li>
                            <li>We understand that AI project success highly depends on the data readiness, so we require a data inventory which addresses questions like where data is stored, type of data, how often data is refresh or updated in realtime. In our scenario, we require contacts, reservations and excursions data in the data inventory. We also perform data cleansing, and data quality issues, data integration challenges early on for successful AI project implementation.</li>
                            <li>We then require a risk profile based on identified risk areas like data leaks, regulatory requirements, reputation harm, determine priorities and apply security, technical and ethical guardrails. Salesforce build an Einstein trust layer that is a collection of features, processes, and policies designed to safeguard data privacy, enhance AI accuracy and promote responsible use of AI across salesforce. We need to keep monitor and audit risk on ongoing basis.</li>

                        <li><strong>Card-3: Calculated Insight </strong>We can then add another data stream for case which will add cases to the Data Object Model, and then relate the case DMO to other DMO objects. We can then build a calculated insight with unified individual ID, case status and aggregated case count as dimensions. 
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Card-4: Data Cloud Segment </strong>We can then build a segment on Unified Indivdual by adding filter that will filter the US Leads whose postal code has no value. We will then create an Activation Target for Data Cloud. We can then create an activation to publish the No Zip Code segment to Data Cloud activation target. The activated records can be viewed through Data Explorer.

                        <li><strong>Card-3: </strong> Admins will setup up the Data Cloud, create users and assign permission sets and depending upon the org factors, you will have a data cloud org provisioned as a new org or an in an existing salesforce org. Irrespectively you will have to proceed to next step of connecting other salesforce org and data sources through external integrations setup tasks, installing data kits, installing packages that creates data streams, DLOs, DMOs. We can then create additional Data Cloud artifacts which can include additional data streams, DLOs, DMOs, Calculated Insigts, Segments, Activation Target and Activations.
                        <br>
                        To jump start the learning, we can connect to “Trial OrgFarm For U” salesforce org which has preconfigured standard data bundles for Sales Cloud, Salesforce CDP CRM Loyalty, Salesforce CDP Salesforce Commerce, Service Cloud.

                        <br>
                        You can install one of these data bundles by creating a new data stream and selecting Salesforce CRM as a connected sources. When you install a Sales Cloud data bundle, you will see that Sales Cloud package with publisher as CDP CRM 1 is installed in the Installed Packages Setup and SalesDK data kit is installed in the Data Kits Setup.

                        <br>
                        You can then see that Data Streams like Account_Home, Lead_Home, Opportunity_Home that are part of Sales Bundle are created and viewable in the list view of Data Streams tab of Data Cloud App.

                        <br>
                        Along with Data Cloud setup and importing standard bundles, you need to prepare the implementation with Data Discovery by identifying other data sources like AWS S3, Data Lakes which will become additional data streams. You also need to work with Data Ethics team to follow data governance and consent procedures that will cover things like GPDR and other data residency requirements. After that comes the understanding of standard customer 360 model and identifying the subject areas in customer 360 model. Next we maintain a data dictionary, use cases inventory, mapping sheets and perform harmonization of data ingested to data cloud by mapping it to customer 360 data model. For eg: The Party Subject Area in Customer 360 model has Indivdual DMO, Party Identification DMO and Account DMO. Individual DMO relates to Party through IndividualId and PartyIdenficationId; and Individual DMO relates to Account through IndividualId and AccountId.
                        <br>
                        Identity Resolution processes several match and reconciliation rules to makes sure that the record is uniquely identified in a unified linked object. The data from unified profiles can be then used for segmentation and activations.
