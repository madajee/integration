                        <li><strong>Roles: </strong><em>AI Engineer</em> operationalize and deploy AI models. Data scientist perform model selection and optimization of deployed models. Data Enginner build pipelines that connect data from different data sources and the unified data is leveraged for all AI/ML related tasks. AI Partners and Consultants bridge the gaps and scale of AI implementation for enterprises.</li>
                        <li><strong>MLOPs: </strong>Practice of  delivering machine learning models. It begins with development and ends with finished model and operational setting. It covers things like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, CI/CD, model registries, API and UIs that expose model operations as a consumption service and ongoing performance monitoring.</li>
                        <li><strong>ML Pipeline Lifecycle: </strong>The purpose to deliver results to an enterprise for critical decision making on a periodic or on demand basis. All three roles mentioned above enables production delivery of ML pipeline.</li>

                        <p>Checkout the Feature Store which house clean data for the model. Data Scientist start the experimentation with raw data analysis, employs the best alogrithm for the solution. Source Repository house the code for models, CI/CD functions deploy the model.  ML Prediction Service offers the results against live data through UI/UX experience or an API. ML Metadata store captures the runtime stats and performance monitoring along with triggeres create a feedack loop with rest of the system.</p>
                        <li><strong>ML Pipeline Layers: </strong>At the bottom is the infrastructure along with security, montoring, automation and resource management which is usually a combination of acclerated computing chips form likes Nvidia and hyperscalers like GCP, AWS, Azure. Orgs and Partners have to create a tool chain that will cover the testing and validation layer. Data Collection and ETL jobs layers populates the clean and unified data into feature store which is vefified and validated AI/ML solution and usecases. We then have Model development, Model monitoring, UI/UX layers which are goverened with MLOps best practices to deliver finished models in production along with consumption service. This process goes through several maturity phases with the help of CI/CD. Phase 1 usually covers lot of decision making at stakeholder level, small group of ground level teams prove out data science to the point that the analytical solution can be operationlized within the enterprise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Model Understanding: </strong>
                        <p>Typically there is an experimental phase with model selection and parameters tuning, and the codebase is in form of Juypter notebooks and just enough infrastructure is provisioned to do proof of concept and fit for purpose analysis. Al Engineer will have to check on few things like best practices, testing approach, troubleshooting guides to categorize the model appropriately in the broad spectrum from experimental to production ready. Things like metrics, inference approach have to be discussed and usually the model that predicts a single numeric outcome are a bit easier than models that have more than one outcome like image classification or labelling models are a bit more complex. In case of a classification model like fraud detection where the outcome will be boolean binary, then we usually use the metric like accuracy which is based on how many cases the model predicted correctly. However for classfying jars of different shape is not a yes / or no answer is a multi class outcome and it can get a bit fuzzy and supported with other two dimensional metrics based on confusion matrix. Some AI engineers want to lean in with data scientist, which may require them to do some deeper dive into maths and statistics topics related to calculating probability, mean, median, average.</p>
                        <p>At times, we will have clean data which can be sliced by business in non AI tools in different categories to analyze the impact and when the same conceptual understanding is applied in AI model, we may train the model using only one of those categories, so in this case MLOps teams goes through a refinement phase of generating the revised versions of model by adding more granularity into Analysis Base Tables.

                            At the core machine learning models are algorithms that learn from the data in the training process. In the morning algorithm, everyone follows a best practice of bruising, bathing so even in our daily life we have series of steps which is a recipe that gets us ready for the day. Just like our brain creates a variation of morning algorithm based on the lifestyle and things like weather, weekend, models uses training data to identify patterns and create algorithms that run on accelerated computing infrastructure to achieve far fetched goals. There are different types of machine learning algorithms like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning. Engineers will learn and understand these different types while working alongside Scientists but the generic view on model understanding should cover the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Input and Output schema of the model including data types and prediction columns</li>
                                <li>Relevant metrics to track based on the model type and business objectives.</li>
                                <li>Training and Inference process along with runtime environment for different types of model</li>
