                <h5 class="text-success">LEAD FEATURE (JUNE)</h5>
                <p>As a L2C Stakeholder, I would like to see that all the Leads that are qualified in our Marketing Application should be created in Salesforce Sales Cloud within an hour. I also require that when Sales Rep convert the lead to create account, contacts and opportunities, we should have an extensible Lead Conversion Engine that relies on standard Convert Lead feature of Sales Cloud. Mulesoft API Implementation Flows should allow us to build Conversion Engine with enterpise specific requirements, rules and processes that we can evolve as we scale and integrate within the realm of enterprise applications for our clients.  All these automation should be triggered through a Mulesoft API resource so that external calls to the Salesforce Lead Object from all internal and external applications should be unified and standardized through an API Layer.</p>

                <h5 class="text-warning">PRODUCT AND PRICEBOOK FEATURE (JULY)</h5>
                <p>As a L2C Stakeholder, I would like to mention that we sell both internationally and in US, so our Salesforce Admin has activated multiple currencies in Salesforce Org Admin has added <i>GBP - British Pound, EUR - Euro, JPY - Japanese Yen,SGD - Singapore Dollar </i> along with <i>USD - US Dollar</i> but the corporate currency is <i>USD - US Dollar</i>. Our product group creates and mantain product sheets to discuss product codes, pricing and other market level product configurations. I would like Automation team to pick up the product sheets on hourly schedule and create / and update products in the Product2 salesforce object and also create the associated pricebook entries in PricebookEntry salesforce object. The pricebook in Pricebook2 salesforce object are created and managed by the product architect manually through salesforce UI. Please take a note that Product Code is how we are going to uniquely idenfiy each product.

                <h5 class="text-info">OPPORTUNTIY AND OPPORTUNITY PRODUCT FEATURE (AUGUST)</h5>
                <p>As a L2C Stakeholder, I would like to see that when we convert both the leads (John Doe and Jane Doe), we should have accounts, opportunity and contact gets created through our extensible Lead Conversion Engine. After the conversion on both leads, we should have both the opportunities: BSofSW - Ground-mounted Panels; Saito - Ground-mounted Panels in our Salesforce Org.
                </p>
                <p>As a Team Lead, I need the capability to update the pricebook, currency and amount on the opportunity. I should then able to add the products to the opportunity with an API resource by passing in the opportunity name along with product list. Product in the list should require product code and quantity whereas the API implementation should pick up the unit price from the price book entry.
