                <h3>User Management API in Mule</h3>
                <p>Let's try to take a agile methodology to work on this POC. Tools: [Anypoint Studio, Postman]<br>
                    <h4>Features: [Register, Login]</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Story-1: </strong>Scaffold an e-store-express-mule application using standard muledev practices with 3 mule configuration files, one with APIkit router that gets generated from RAML API specification, second for the global configuration and third for authentication and supporting flows.</li>
                        <li><strong>Story-2: </strong>Add the POST for register endpoint and use the mule generate flow feature (APIkit router) to generate the interface flow. We also need to test the generated flow with the request and response in the raml api spec. Request can be as simple as a username, password and name.</li>
                        <li><strong>Story-3: </strong>Add the POST for login endpoint and use the mule generate flow feature (APIkit router) to generate the interface flow. Test the generated flow. Request can be as simple as a username, password.</li>
                        <li><strong>Story-4: </strong>POC with Mule 4 OAuth2 provider with provider config, 2 default object store for client, token. Understand the provider operations like create client, delete client, validate token.</li>
                        <li><strong>Story-5: </strong>Create a collection for e-store-express-mule with login and register endpoint.</li>
                    </ul>
