                <p>Focus on videos with architecture content.<br>Tools: [Anypoint Studio, NodeJS, YouTube videos]<br>
                    <h4>Features: [Architecture Coverage, Error Handling]</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Card-1: </strong>[Architecture Coverage]: Advance architecture understanding by listening to videos that has architecture asides. Similar to [Mule Coverage] card started in fanta.f2, cards like these will follow continum style of moving across sprints.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-2: </strong>Add the correlationId in the e-store-express-mule app. First test with mapping correlationId to TransactionId in the response for one of the endpoint. Explore configuration to generate custom correlationId and also use the tracing module vm publish flow to add username along with correlationId while mapping to transactionId.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-3: </strong>n the e-store-express-mule app, we will get an error when the register endpoint is called twice with the same username as the first call will create the client in the OAuth provider. [Error Type: OAUTH2-PROVIDER:CLIENT_ALREADY_EXISTS, Message: The client with ID: test1 is already registered]. Publish the error to the errorq with the transactionId (set as correlationId) and msgtype (set as register).
                        {"transactionId":"9e56521b.ec30.4709.b477.c743f3854063","msgtype":"register","transactionstatus":"Failed","error":{"description":"The client with ID: test1 is already registered","type":"APPERROR:CLIENT_ALREADY_EXISTS","cause":"The client with ID: test1 is already registered"}}</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-4: </strong>In the “estoreexpress-subscriberapi-mule”, add the listener flow for the errorq and test for "transactionId":"9e56521b.ec30.4709.b477.c743f3854063" from card-4. Log the error with the logger component but as we move along we will have to persist these kind of errors from the queue.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-5: </strong>Start dev in NodeJS by scaffolding e-store-express with npm init; require express module; log port in the callback function of express app listen method. Use require on config file to read the port property.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Architects sugget to broadly understand application classification as monoliths and distributed. Monoliths are single deployable unit whereas distributed are multiple deployable units in application context. Monoliths implementations are somewhat simple, less expensive as compared to distributed because of complexity in cross cutting concern and how the application is designed for architecture characterstics (eg: scalability, availability etc).</li>
                            <li>Architects favor parallel workstream for devOps and development in implementation programs for fast release cycles and require technical teams to increase technical breadth in relevant areas that may not fall into the core skills.</li>
