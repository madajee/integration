                    <h4>Features: [Deployment Options, Error Handling]</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Card-1: </strong>[Mule Applications Coverage]: Advance mule coverage understanding by watching mule community videos, training session. Add short notes in each sprint.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-2: </strong>Create a common error handler that can be copied and tailored across projects. Scaffold the flow with multiple Error Propage scope for few error types and the bottom one should be for ANY Error Type.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-3: </strong>Create a canonical error dwl that should create a error payload using the error object.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-4: </strong>Create the configuration element to specify common error handler as default error handler and test for couple of error on the OAuth components.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-5: </strong>Create the errorq for error payload along with common publish subflow which can be referenced from On Error Propagate scopes of Common Error Handler.</li>
                    </ul>

                    In the context of Anypoint Platform, there is a runtime plane and control plane. Products and features that let you create, manage and discover mule applications without local setup are included in control plane like Design Center, Exchange, Management Center. Runtime plane is mule runtime along with services like connectors, extensions. Anypoint Studio includes the non-licensed / non-clustered setup of mule runtime in the studio for developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the On-perm model, the control plane is hosted with Mulesoft for the customer org, mule agent connects mule applications running on VMs in  customer datacenter to the control plane. In this setup, there are several mule applications run in a single JVM / mule server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cloud model is when both  control and runtime plane hosted with Mulesoft with an iPaas cloudhub offering which is built on  AWS Infrastructure as a Service offering. Mulesoft Cloudhub Offering provides different options like Cloudhub 1.0 (Cloud Workers), Cloudhub 2.0 (Cloud Containers), Runtime Fabric (On-perm containers).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the migration journeys, there is a hybrid deployment model when the mule applications are deployed both in customer data center and in cloudhub.
