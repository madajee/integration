                    <ul>
                        <li>In the Admin beginner trail, we learn to navigate with salesforce apps and platform, install learner packages like dreamhouse, customize the lightning experience and build reports and dashboards.</li>
                        <li>In the Admin Intermediate trail, we start to get into point and click solutions. We can add formulas, roll up summary fields to objects for things how long the opportunity is open, sum of opportunities for an account. Objects have a validation rule features which helps you with field level rules, conditions like zipcode for contact should be same as related account zip code.</li>
                        <li>With Data security module, we start to learn that platform offer different levels through which admin can control access. Different levels are org level, object level, field level and even the record level. Profiles are the main tool through which access is granted but there are things like Permission Sets, Role hierarchies and Sharing rules through which access to data and objects can be further managed.</li>
                        <li>We learn how to configure picklists so that users can pick the correct value from the dropdown and data entry issues.</li>
                        <li>We also build a custom apps like suggestion box and space station apps. In these modules, we build with techniques learned in data modeling, lightning experience customization to create a lightning app with point and click solutions.</li>
                        <li>With features like email templates, global actions and approval processes, we can automate tasks like converting prospects to customers when prospects meet the entry criteria.</li>

                        <li><strong>Card-1: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Flow Builder Basics: One of ways we can automate tasks in salesforce and create point and click business automation is with Flow Builder. Flow Builder let you create both Interactive experiences with feature like Screen Ffows, Autolaunched flows and trigger based automation with features like Record Triggered, Schedule Triggered etc. Flow Builder has building blocks in form of Interaction Elements (Screen), Data Elements (Create Records, Get Records) and Logic Elements (Assignment, Decision). We create resources for things like variable and formulas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-2: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Data and Actions in Flows: As users work on record details and save them, we create trigger based flows which can be configured with record selection criteria and uses data elements like get records, create records. Data Elements like Get Records create variable which holds the data record values which can be aggregated to create records in related objects or actions like email, alerts and chatter post. We can reference the running user profile and fields values with global variables.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-3: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Flow Builder Logic: We build the logic in the flows with the decision elements to create multiple paths , use assignment operators to copy values in the variables, reuse common tasks with subflows and use permissions and global variables to create different outcomes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-4: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Record Triggered Flows: Create a <em>Review Opportunity with Account Owner</em> flow which is based on the opportunity object, and we have specified the conditions. It creates an email task for the account owner. It also has a scheduled path which gets trigger 3 days after the last modified date on the opportunity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-5: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Autolaunched and Scheduled Flows: Create a <em>Clone Closed Case</em> flow which is an autolaunched flow which clones the case and we trigger it with the action button on the case record.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-6: </strong>Complete the following trail step, Screen Flows: Complete a <em>Create Case for Contact</em> has the couple of screen elements that covers elements like textarea, toggle, radio and checkbox components. It then uses create record element to create a case record based on input data from screen components.</li>
                        <li><strong>Card-7: </strong>Complete the following trail: Prepare for Salesforce Releases
                            <p>Salesforce Products and Platform Features are released in Spring, Summer and Winter releases. Customers generally explore release features with preview instances and promote customizations with non-preview instances in the release months. It is suggested to use filters to go through release notes and quick wins features are something easy to start for release managers.</p>
                            <p>Releases generally require a bit of planning with focused approach and it is recommended in trail: <em>Forward Plan; Roles, Responsibilities and Release Processes, Advance Tools</em></p>
                            <p>Understand the gaps in the released features and how it will be absorbed in the existing UIs and business processes. Depending upon complexity of the org salesforce environment and number of licensed users, you may need to define roles, responsibilities, apply testing approaches covering unit, integration, uat and create advance tooling in the form of spreadsheets with release matrixes or custom object to list new features. Release Teams also have to make sure adoption of new features.</p>
                            <p>Some of the Einstein and Platform features for Spring'25 are AI Assisted Agent Generation, Testing and Policy Center. Mulesoft Agentforce features include Topic Center, AI Chain Connector. Data Cloud can use Unstructed Audi and Video Content.</p>
                            <p>Einstein features improve Productivity and Decision Making with Recommended Actions and Contextual Summaries.</p>

                        <li><strong>Card-3: </strong> Admins will setup up the Data Cloud, create users and assign permission sets and depending upon the org factors, you will have a data cloud org provisioned as a new org or an in an existing salesforce org. Irrespectively you will have to proceed to next step of connecting other salesforce org and data sources through external integrations setup tasks, installing data kits, installing packages that creates data streams, DLOs, DMOs. We can then create additional Data Cloud artifacts which can include additional data streams, DLOs, DMOs, Calculated Insigts, Segments, Activation Target and Activations.
                        <br>
                        To jump start the learning, we can connect to “Trial OrgFarm For U” salesforce org which has preconfigured standard data bundles for Sales Cloud, Salesforce CDP CRM Loyalty, Salesforce CDP Salesforce Commerce, Service Cloud.

                        You can install one of these data bundles by creating a new data stream and selecting Salesforce CRM as a connected sources. When you install a Sales Cloud data bundle, you will see that Sales Cloud package with publisher as CDP CRM 1 is installed in the Installed Packages Setup and SalesDK data kit is installed in the Data Kits Setup.

                        <br>
                        You can then see that Data Streams like Account_Home, Lead_Home, Opportunity_Home that are part of Sales Bundle are created and viewable in the list view of Data Streams tab of Data Cloud App.

                        Along with Data Cloud setup and importing standard bundles, you need to prepare the implementation with Data Discovery by identifying other data sources like AWS S3, Data Lakes which will become additional data streams. You also need to work with Data Ethics team to follow data governance and consent procedures that will cover things like GPDR and other data residency requirements. After that comes the understanding of standard customer 360 model and identifying the subject areas in customer 360 model. Next we maintain a data dictionary, use cases inventory, mapping sheets and perform harmonization of data ingested to data cloud by mapping it to customer 360 data model. For eg: The Party Subject Area in Customer 360 model has Indivdual DMO, Party Identification DMO and Account DMO. Individual DMO relates to Party through IndividualId and PartyIdenficationId; and Individual DMO relates to Account through IndividualId and AccountId.
                        <br>
                        Identity Resolution processes several match and reconciliation rules to makes sure that the record is uniquely identified in a unified linked object. The data from unified profiles can be then used for segmentation and activations.
