When an agent is created and deployed, it starts with a role and set of instructions. As the agent asked to do certain tasks, it understands the request, reason through it, searches through documents, knowledge articles and then prompts the Large Language Model. It also calls on the available tools to complete the job. While it performs on the job it keeps on learning and generally works towards a goal of getting better with each task.</li>
