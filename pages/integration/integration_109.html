                <h3>Cloud Walker</h3>
                <p>Cloud Computing categorizes product offering at three layers acronymed as SAAS, PAAS and IAAS. Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) is bottom layer, Platform as a Service (PAAS) is the middle layer and Software as a Service (SAAS) is the top layer.</p>
                <p>Software as a Service (SaaS): Full Lifecycle Software Application created and managed by the Service Providers over the cloud. Eg: Salesforce, Gmail, Office 365. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Focused on deployment and management of the developer apps without any hassle of owning or managing any infrastructure. Eg: Heroku, Elastic Bean Stalk, Google App Engine. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Pay as Go configurations to basic building blocks of cloud IT like compute capacity, storage, network without worrying about leasing data centres and capital expendiure in large servers. Eg: Amazon AWS, Microsoft AZURE, Google GCP.</p>
                <p>Over the past decade, most public Cloud Service Providers have created hundreds of services which are scaled on the Compute, Network, Storage and Database services which are backed by Data Centers, Network backbone, Region & Zones, Point of Presence locations, Global Access Management Layer, Self Service with Console & SDKs, Pay as Go Billing.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Several legacy applications and platforms rely on Lift and Shift architectural approach and provision compute engine virtual machines from public cloud providers. One can have full control over the opertaing system and compute capacity with configurable network & storage options. Applications can transition to cloud with minimal changes & infrastructure resources can scale in and scale out as per application needs.</p>
                <p>Alternate approach is to rewrite the applications using architectural patterns that comply with microservices principles and thus provisioning Kubernetes clusters to deploy, manage and scale containerized workloads.</p>
                <p>Over the past many years, web developers have created cloud native application by following twelve factor methodology which are deployed on compute platforms like App Engine, Beanstalk. This provides a felxible zero ops approach to application deployment & monitoring where developer velocity is preferred over infrastructure control.</p>
                <p>As the cloud application scales & moves towards event driven executions for usecases like IOT & Big Data, there can be several services which can leverage serverless environment like google cloud functions, AWS lambda.</p>
                <p>Each public cloud provider offers relational, No-SQL, object storage & block storage offerings that can provisioned in the cloud model as per the application needs and requirements. For eg: GCP offers Cloud SQL for MySQL, Postgres RDMS instances. GCP has created Spanner RDMS from ground up for mission critical applications that require persistence in multiple regions.</p>
                <p>Some of the other big categories are Big Data and Machine Learning. Cloud Providers also provide management and developer tools.</p>
