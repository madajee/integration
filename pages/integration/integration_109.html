            <p>Cloud Computing categorizes product offering at three layers acronymed as SAAS, PAAS and IAAS. Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) is bottom layer, Platform as a Service (PAAS) is the middle layer and Software as a Service (SAAS) is the top layer.</p>
            <p>Software as a Service (SaaS): Full Lifecycle Software Application created and managed by the Service Providers over the cloud. Eg: Salesforce, Gmail, Office 365. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Focused on deployment and management of the developer apps without any hassle of owning or managing any infrastructure. Eg: Heroku, Elastic Bean Stalk, Google App Engine. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Pay as Go configurations to basic building blocks of cloud IT like compute capacity, storage, network without worrying about leasing data centres and capital expendiure in large servers. Eg: Amazon AWS, Microsoft AZURE, Google GCP.</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, most public Cloud Service Providers have created hundreds of services which are scaled on the Compute, Network, Storage and Database services which are backed by Data Centers, Network backbone, Region & Zones, Point of Presence locations, Global Access Management Layer, Self Service with Console & SDKs, Pay as Go Billing.</p>

            <p>Some of the other big categories are Big Data and Machine Learning. Cloud Providers also provide management and developer tools.</p>
