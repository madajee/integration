                <h3>Evolving Game</h3>
                <p>
                    In my experience, integrating systems, people and processes has been a hard ball, and the game of it just keeps evolving. There are several dimensions around this term, but my experience has been in system integration in the enterprise ecosystem. However with cloud, mobility and social integration ways, we all have to just keep learning, and relaxation is necessary exercise.

                <h3>Integration Timeline</h3>
                <ul class="timeline">
                    <li>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100">File Based Batch Integrations</a>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100" class="float-right">Sevetys going into Eightys</a>
                        <p>Gained popularity by pushing data feeds into giant monoliths like mainframes and even used today with FTP on B2B integrations. Architects approched integrations with Batch Processes that consume and process data files.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100">Two Tier Architectural Style, MOMs, Real-Time Synchronous RPC</a>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100" class="float-right">Eightys going into Nintys</a>
                        <p>Application Architecture was about 2-tiered architectural style developed with data residing in Oracle DB and Microsoft SQL Server, development of MOMs products like IBM MQ Series and ERPs like SAP, Oracle, WMS, Financial and Accounting Systems. Architects approached integration design with RPC style calls with shared databases and broker based CORBA architectures.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100">ERPs, Web 1.0, Multi-Tier Architecture with Sun JAVA, Microsoft .NET Stacks</a>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100" class="float-right">Nintys going to 2000</a>
                        <p>Deployment of Packaged Applications like SAP, Oracle, JD Edwards, PeopleSoft gained momemtum and became system of records. Internet and Web based architectural style gained popularity with Java & .Net stack. Architects included asynchronous style message oriented middleware implemented with standards like MQ and JMS.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100">SOAP Webservices, EAI, Hub & Spoke Brokers</a>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100" class="float-right">2000 to 2005</a>
                        <p>Both business and technical leaders were required to integrate application silos and synchronous style converged towards SOAP based webservices and asynchronous style converged towards Brokers, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) to address integration needs and challenges. Business use cases were orchestrated and composed with Business Process Manager(BPM) products.</p>
                        <p>Niche integration vendors like WebMethods and TIBCO created products that implemented EAI and BPM patterns.Large enterprises and internet  companies started enabling SOA architectures with interoperable services using the SOAP protocol and data exchange with XML, and deployments on Application Servers like Weblogic, Websphere based on Java EE6.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100">Enterprise Service Bus, Business Process Management</a>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100" class="float-right">2005 to 2010</a>
                        <p>Bus pattern started to emerge where architects analyzed that a lot of application and business logic is being developed in the middle tier and though it provides speedy services, we end up with criss cross connections and overtime, middleware becomes monoliths which are difficult to maintain and we have to correlate across application & transaction boundaries. In spite of centralized middleware, we will be better off with a service bus that is based on components, and uses DSL for rapid development. Application/Services connects with the Service Bus on edges and integration developers leverages service bus capabilities to address integration design tasks like validation, enrichment, transformation, routing. ESB products are usually runtimes with low memory footprints which are either provisioned along with Application Server like OSB on Weblogic server, or developed with open source community way like Mule ESB, Apache Camel with enterprise licensing backed by organizations like Mulesoft, Red Hat.</p>

                        <a href="#!/integration/100">Cloud Computing,Mobility, Social, IAAS, PAAS , SAAS</a>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100" class="float-right">2010 going to 2015</a>
                        <p>We know about hypervisor, virtual servers but it is very different when you can provision a server with a click and choose the hardware configuration with a template. Cloud computing basically automated hardware provisioning with software tools and implementation of elastic design moved architecture layers into the cloud (IAAS, PAAS and SAAS). Products developed with cloud native architecture saw huge growth and all of these products are backed by APIs and platforms.</p>
                        <p>Web interestingly is not the only client after the invention of the iPhone, and it is very different when there are platforms connecting millions of people. Smartphones are also enabling smart devices and there are billions of devices connected on the network which is called Internet of Things.</p>

                    <li>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100">Microservices, API</a>
                        <a href="#!/integration/100" class="float-right">2015 going to 2020</a>
                        <p>Implementation stack at platform companies like Netflix explained that instead of monoliths, we have to develop components and services modeled around business domains that can be scaled and deployed independently. Architects approached integration with REST based API.</p>

                        <a href="#!/integration/100" class="float-right">2020...</a>
                        <p>When we listen to industry tycoons and executives, we are being reminded about changing times, but hearing them will give you a lot of optimism about the bright side of innovation. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In my opinion, applications will continue to evolve into products and integrators will have to find ways to open up legacy features with enablement of API and Cloud Platforms. Both application and integration developers have to develop & mature product features with cloud native principles.
                        </p>
