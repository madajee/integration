            <h3>AWS Starter</h3>
            <p>There are 3 public cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Azure). All public cloud providers have datacenters in several regions across the globe. Identity and Access Management Services are global and allows you to manage Users, Group, Roles and JSON policy documents. Regions further has Availability Zones to cover failover and uptime needs. Services like EC2 templatize intance types with varied compute, memory and storage capacities & categorized as instance families. One can use self service consoles to provision cloud resources in a scalable manner with different prciging models like on-demand, reserved, spot etc. Additional disk capacity can be provisioned by attaching EBS Volumes to instances and features like automatic replication covers basic failover and high availability requirements.</p>
            <p>Elastic Load Balancers are available at Application layer (Layer 7 / HTTP) and Network layer (Layer 4 / TCP). Route53 / Google Domains is the DNS service that allows to map IP address of AWS resources to public domain name.</p>
            <p>Database Services like RDS provision Database clusters of the chosen relational database like Oracle, MYSQL, SQLServer in minutes if not seconds. AWS offers Aurora for OLTP workloads and RedShift for OLAP workloads. Snapshots is additional feature for enabling robust backup and recovery options. One can also improve performance for read intensive applications by provisioning Read Replicas in the another region or Availability Zone.</p>
            <p>Cloud providers like AWS created highly available object based storage service for accessing images and large blob files over the internet with S3 service. Simple Storage Service manages data as objects and associate each object with a unique key. Each object is underneath within a bucket & S3 bucket name is globally unique. An example of S3 URL: https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key-name.
            Several storage options are available with the variation of access frequency, price and other archival requirements. There are features build into S3 service like encryption, ACLs and policies that allows you to manage the security of the data. Service Providers that have users across the multiple geographies can avail services like Cloudfront and Transfer acceleration for better performance.</p>
