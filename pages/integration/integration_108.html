            <h3>AWS Starter</h3>
            <p>As we all know that AWS (Amazon), GCP (Google) and Azure (Microsoft) are 3 major public cloud providers . All three public cloud providers have datacenters in several regions across the globe. Identity and Access Management Services are global and allows you to manage Users, Group, Roles and JSON policy documents. Regions further has Availability Zones to cover failover and uptime needs. Services like EC2 templatize intance types with varied compute, memory and storage capacities & categorized as instance families. One can use self service consoles to provision cloud resources in a scalable manner with different prciging models like on-demand, reserved, spot etc. Additional disk capacity can be provisioned by attaching EBS Volumes to instances and features like automatic replication covers basic failover and high availability requirements.</p>
            <p>Elastic Load Balancers are available at Application layer (Layer 7 / HTTP) and Network layer (Layer 4 / TCP). Route53 / Google Domains is the DNS service that allows to map IP address of AWS resources to public domain name.</p>
            <p>Database Services like RDS provision Database clusters of the chosen relational database like Oracle, MYSQL, SQLServer in minutes if not seconds. AWS offers Aurora for OLTP workloads and RedShift for OLAP workloads. Snapshots is additional feature for enabling robust backup and recovery options. One can also improve performance for read intensive applications by provisioning Read Replicas in the another region or Availability Zone.</p>
            <p>Cloud providers like AWS created highly available object based storage service for accessing images and large blob files over the internet with S3 service. Simple Storage Service manages data as objects and associate each object with a unique key. Each object is underneath within a bucket & S3 bucket name is globally unique. An example of S3 URL: https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key-name.
            Several storage options are available with the variation of access frequency, price and other archival requirements. There are features build into S3 service like encryption, ACLs and policies that allows you to manage the security of the data. Service Providers that have users across the multiple geographies can avail services like Cloudfront and Transfer acceleration for better performance.</p>
            <p>Some businesses are really big on serverless and AWS Lambda lets you choose the function runtime and allow you to upload your function code. There is no need to provision an infrastructure or install any runtime and rather the charges will be based on the number of invocations / or requests to the function. In AWS platform, one can provision API gateways, SQS, SNS resources which can act as a trigger to the lambda call when an appropriate event is fired.</p>
            <p>Lot of modern applications rely on nosql DB like MongoDB, Cassandra, DynomoDB as they are schemaless, document based model, distributed and key/values pairs can be raplidly added / removed along with agile development techniques of modern apps. DynamoDB is a low latency NoSQL database and supports Eventual consitent as well as Strongly consistent DB writes.</p>
            <p>One of the oldest services in AWS are Simple Queue Service (Pull) and Simple Notification Service (Push). Applications enable asynchronous pattern by pushing messages to the SQS which can then processed by job pollers to perform the desired task based on the message content and appropriate response can be returned to the application source components and job completion status can be published to desired senders with notifications.</p>
            <p>Developers really want to focus on developing application and not worry about any of the underlying infrastructure, runtime installs, OS patches and server montioring. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an end to end application management PAAS platform for deploying and scaling web applications & servcies developed with mostly all popular programming languages on familiar servers like Apache, Nginx & others. All a developer need to do is upload the application code zip file & select appropriate runtime platform and Beanstalk will provision underlying EC2 instances & other resources, install the appropriate runtime and provide you with the URL for the web application.</p>
            <p>Agile Practices of Software Development requires automation in build and release process so that features can be shipped to users sooner than later. Most cloud platforms have devops tools that enable best practices of CI/CD. Continuous Integration allow devlopers to push code changes several times a day and as build process is scripted & automated, changes are immediately available in development and test environments for rapid feedback cycle. Continuous Deployment / Delivery provides several deployment strategies like Rolling Update, Blue/Green, Canary and manual review can be added in delivery pipleline before the features are relesed into production environments. AWS provides several developer tools like Code Commit (Source and version Control), Code Build (Compiles Code, Run Tests and generated deployable artifacts), Code Pipeline (Scripts Build and Deployment workflows), Code Deploy (Integrates with cloud resources like EC2, Deployment Servers and pushes deployable artifacts to different environments).</p>
            <p>One of the key feature of public cloud is that you can write scripts & create templates that can be managed in version control to provision the cloud resources. DevOps practices that manage, configure and provision AWS resources with Cloudformation templates are specified Infrastructure as a code (IAAS). Cloudformation allows you to provision the infrastructure in a consistent & efficient way and as templates are managed in version control, infrastructure resources can be quickly provisioned, updated and rolled back as per the application need.</p>
