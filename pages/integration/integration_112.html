            <h3>Mule Walker</h3>
            <p>Though Dataweave is now in 2.4 release, it was released with Mule 3.7 as DWL 1.0 and was designed from ground up to providing next generation transformation capabilities at speed and scale. A DataWeave script consists of a header and a body, separated by three dashes (---). One can define functions in the script, use function modules as part of the runtime. Dataweave follows the core principles of functional programming, including pure functions, first-class functions, high-order functions, function composition, lambda expressions, and immutable data. Some of the higher order functions like map, mapObject, reduce allow you to simplify complex transformations on large dataset with few lines of DWL. An example script from mule docs uses multi-value selector, define custom type for format.</p>
            <pre>
                <code> 
                %dw 2.0
                output application/json
                type Currency = String { format: "\$#,###.00"}
                ---
                books: payload.items.*item map
                    book:
                        price: $.price as Currency
                </code>                    
            </pre> 
            <p><strong>API : </strong>One of the guiding principle of Restful architecture is uniform constraint and API Designer allows you to create API specifications in RAML / OAS. Mocking service can simulate API request and responses for all methods on API resources as per the specification and allows you to refine your API specification as per  requirements analysis and design perspectives. In the build phase muleys can scaffold the implementation mule flows based on the API Spec and the scaffolding leverages the Mule APIkit router component. Munit can be added and test runners are enabled in build piplelines to meet appropriate coverage. Anypoint Exchange is a registry and portal interface for published APIs. Based on the deployment topology, mule apps can be deployed either on the on-premise servers in client managed datacenters or in mulesoft provided fully managed cloud service on Cloudhub.</p>
            <p><strong>Cloudhub: </strong>One of the key architectural aspect that has been enabled in anypoint platform is separation of runtime plane and management plane. Cloudhub is product that ufifies several aspects of it for different personas and organization groups. As the name suggests, it is integration product engineered for cloud with cloud computing of fully managed infrastruture provisioning, self service, scalable vCore licenses, faster deployments and upgrades on mule application supported by developer tools like Runtime Manager API, CLI and UI. Though Runtime Manager UI is the unified view for deploying and managing mule applications and has multi-tenant architecture with Organization & Business Groups, underneath cloudhub has 2 major components: Platform Services and Worker Cloud. Platform Services handles common concerns like logging, alerting, Insight, Account Management, VPC & Load Balancing and is shared across all client deployments. Worker Cloud is elastic and multitenant cloud of virtual machines provisioned by on demand infrastructure resources from public cloud providers with mulesoft installed runtime components. Limits and Allocation to the resources in mule worker cloud is bucketed with vCores which are licensed as per Client contracts. Cloudhub has in-build features for availablity, redundancy, intelligent healing and zero-downtime updates. As all communication between platform services and worker cloud is over SSL, cloudhub is secure for integrations.</p>
            <p><strong>MUnit: </strong>Along with developing mule applications as per the requirements, architecture, design, it is also quite important to test the applications and munit comes in quite handy for the unit and integration testing. One can also integrate automated test step in the build and deploy pipelines with the required test coverage. As the tooling for Munit testing is build into the studio, muleys can create munits test suite along with mule apps and can easily promote test driven development approach in the integration projects. Munit has full suite of integration and unit test capabilities and is integrated with Maven and Surefire for CI/CD.It is also important to follow practices like appropriate naming on testing flows, write maintainable flows and using subflow feature for reuse and specific test validations.<br>
            <strong><i>Munit Test Suite Bells & Whistles: </i></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Before Suite (run once before all tests)</li>
                <li>Before Test (run once before every test)</li>
                <li>Set Event (define mule messages that serve as input to tested flows)</li>
                <li>Mock Processors (mock results from external dependencies like DB Adapters, Rest Connectors)</li>
                <li>Spy Processors (run assertions and validations before and after the spied processor)</li>
                <li>Assertions (Assert That, Assert Equals, Assert That with Matchers, Assert Expression offers comparable capabilites with other testing frameworks like Hamcrest)</li>
