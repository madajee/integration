            <p>Docker- It has been almost a decade when Docker build a container runtime build on Linux features and standardize the container image format to solve problem of packaging & distributing container images at scale by creating docker registry.</p>
            <p>Kubernetes - As Google guys were using containers for a long time, they had Borg which was incubated as a open source project as Kubernetes. Soon it became the defacto standard for container orchestration platform and all 3 public cloud proivders (GCP, Azure, AWS) create a service that will let you spin Kubernetes Cluster without provisioning any infrastructure & software licenses.</p>
            <p>Kubernetes along with Docker & several other related techlogies like Service Mesh and cloud computing is leading the way for enterprise grade microservices implementations at scale. I am also hoping to join this transformtative journer with a quick starter on Kubernetes ! </p>
