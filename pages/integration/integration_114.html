                <h3>DevOps Learner</h3>
                <p>Though Agile promise to increase velocity along with customer delight, the promise can't be fulfilled until DevOps is adopted along with Agile. Agile and DevOps together require developers, testers, deployers, maintainers & operators to understand the change in organizational culture, learn new tools and processes, implement CI/CD, increase collaboration & automation. Often times, it is easier said than done as we have to break the silos, accept failure as normal occurence, increase observability and measure everything. One of the ways to achieve this is by implementing gradual change and leverage tooling & automation.</p>
                <p>Software is a big elephant that goes through a lifecycle of discovery & planning (Product, Business and Program Guys); Build & Test (Implementation & Development Guys); Deploy & Release (System Admins, Script Developers, Network and Infrastructure Experts); Monitor, Troubleshoot & Continuous Improvement (Sustainment Guys). DevOps is a change in mindset, adoption of practices and tools that enables a shift left culture and allow teams to release features frequently & predictably from git repositories to different envrionments. DevOps guys are keen observers on the repositories & its dependencies, branching and merging, automation of pipeline tasks, monitoring, fixing and reporting pipeline failures. A thing that happens after a developer makes a commit to the repository is that the build process gets triggered and devops pipeline actionize the subsequent steps and the goal is to have a successful deployment of commit in all the environments. There are few common steps of compile, test and deploy that gets executed in a pipeline with an appropriate runtime based on the codebase. A mature devops pipeline also enables security checks, blue green & canary deployment scenarios, alerts & notification mechanisms.</p>
                <p><strong>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery / Deployment: </strong>Some of the few things that I am still learning when working on projects that involved CI/CD tools are listed below but it is critical practice in DevOps initiative and involves understanding several aspects of existing delivery processes and tools in an organization.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Git Branching and Merging</li>
                        <li>Test runs and coverage criteria in the devops pipelines and the variation when deployments is automated across different environments.</li>
                        <li>Adoption of tools that creates pipelines based on docker images whether it is for build servers or build artifacts.</li>
                        <li>Adoption of build platforms that support techniques like feature flags, security scans, push button deployments, efficient rollback approaches, observability metrics.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Continuous Integration is more geared towards cloning, building and testing the changes on another machine than developer workstation by running build, test and deply commands along with appropriate test harnesses as pipeline scripts, job and artifact management with tools like Jenkins, Artifactory; monitoring status and alerting teams on failed builds. It also include deploying the generated artifacts on development and integration servers, stopping and starting the required services.</p>
                <p>Continous Delivery builds up automation in Continuous Integration, streamlines the quality gate checks as the generated artifacts goes through a release and test cycles in up stream enviornments including production or production like environment where it get validated with production traffic either through canary or blue-green approaches. Continuous Deployment is more like pushing into production environments and feature availability is managed through feature flags.</p>
                <p><strong>Testing: </strong>Product and Program Managers creates the roadmap with epics and features. Architecture and Delivery guys run planning and grooming session which produces a backlog with user stories along with milestone, launch and release timeline. User stories generally are offshoots of use cases / scenarios and map to the technical artifacts like service, modules and components. Stories are further elaborated and also include database, infrastructure and testing tasks which are sometimes less or more complex than development tasks. As developer and devops perspective starts to put some weight on the user stories, we usually see more requirements that cover the non-functional aspects and underlying impact on existing business processes and data models. Teams that have been doing agile for a while usually develop in languages and with frameworks that scaffolds test suites with basic plumbling into the development repositories. Developers are expected to run the unit tests and meet the coverage criteria before code is pushed into the repository. As the code changes are pushed to Integration environments, automation in the build pipeline should execute test runs that checks on the availability of services, validate the input and outputs, connectvity to databases & required services. At times these checks are manual as it depends on the phase of the implementation and maturity of devops automation across the organization. DevOps teams also manage and govern the rollback scenarios by enabling deployment strategies like Blue / Green or Canary while Dev/QA guys covers the acceptance tests on scenarios / usecases.</p>
