                <p>Though I have worked on system transformation earlier, but leaders and their talks are mentioning that the next era belongs to digital transformation. Generally there is an organization vision that helps us understand impact on underlying business processes and systems. I also hear in talks that Digital Journey of an organization is backed by Digital Strategy and overall digital play is extremely difficult for many organizations. Digital strategy is chartered by C-Levels and defined by graduates from B-school. Teams at clients and partner organizations transforms the digital strategy into transformation programs that starts with artifacts like challenges, scoping, current state, future state and I have seen few of those in integration programs and projects. I have also observed that some of the smart analysts in the program produce gap analysis artifacts that governs the driving forces and decisions on my different aspects of the programs.</p>
                <p>Most webinars, trails that I can listen and read suggest that Integration is at heart of digital strategy and there are numerous solutions that salesforce and partner orgs are delivering for customers. One of the challenge across several domains is to unify customer data. As a mule designer, the next thing is to learn the customer 360 solution and as fintech webinar and discussion is trending, it can provide some qualitative points to this blog. Some of the common trade-offs in this learning exercise to research appropriate sources so that alloted time, underlying cost and effort produces desired outputs. Everyone reading the blog is encouraged to follow a certain variation of project style work to reap benefits of this exercise. Teams that create these solutions are very diverse, accomodating and leaders add lot of other ingredients to get the outcomes in digital programs. </p>
                <p>An example illustration for this learning view is to go through customer 360 solution as Intake Journey and Fedrated Customer Profile. We should understand though that most organizations that have large customer base have many different systems that host the customer data and a transaction in any business process has many interaction points. Many organizations also have MDM systems for key business entities like Customer, Product etc. Assumuing that we need a 3 layered solution which is mostly recommended with API Led connectivity, the design exercise will have to focus on identifying customer data across several systems, and determining the domain specific requirements. Initially it may be a bit beneficial to couple the system and domain APIs along with thin UI views. Later several thin UI views can be combined in a dashboard portal which may be Gen 1 customer 360 solution. Though profileDB, onboarding and Intake journeys provides the stepping stone, but it is the experience API, industry specific journeys and analytics engine that will help you get ROI in these digital programs.</p>
