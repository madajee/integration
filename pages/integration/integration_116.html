            <h3>Greeting API</h3>
            <p>In this globally connected planet, we should able to greet each other with Hello, Good Morning in the language that other person unbderstands! We will develop a Greeting API that will request you to pass in 2 params, greeting in English like hello | good morning and language like es (spanish) | hi (hindi) | de (german).
                <ul>
                    <li>Sceanrio 1: Requestor will pass in hello and es. A response with hola and spanish is expected.</li>
                    <li>Scenario 2: Requestor will pass in good morning and es. A response with buenos dias and spanish is expected.</li>
                    <li>Scenario 3: Requestor will pass in hello and de. A response with hallo and german is expected.</li>
                    <li>Scenario 4: Requestor will pass in good morning and de. A response with guten morgen is expected.</li>
                    <li>Scenario 5: Requestor will pass in hello and hi. A response with namaste and hindi is expected.</li>
                    <li>Scenario 6: Requestor will pass in good morning and hi. A response with shubh prabhat and hindi is expected.</li>
                </ul>
            We will design a API specification with greeting resource with a get method and 2 query parameters of greet and lang. We also need 2 enum datatypes for greeting and language inputs. We can have start with enum for greet as hello | good morning and enum for lang as en | es | hi. The response from the API can be something like  {greeting: hola, lang: spanish}.</p>
