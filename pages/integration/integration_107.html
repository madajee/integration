            <h3>Mule Starter</h3>
            <p>When you create your first hello world mule application in studio, you will create a localhost enpoint with a configured URI like hello and use the HTTP connector, logger and payload components. One can observe the start-up logs in the studio console and access the listener endpoint in the browser or postman client.</p>
            <p>In mule projects, developers usually end up creating multiple mule configuration files, however a common pattern is to create common configuration in global file (global.xml), create different environment properties file and use global property for env key so that appropriate properties file is loaded in an environment. We are also required to secure the environment properties usually with Mule Secure Configuration module and Blowfish algorithm.</p>
            <p>Mule API Lifecycle requires you to take top-down approach to API, so designers are required to create and publish the API spec in Anypoint Platform (Design Center, Exchange). API Developers have to create API Id in API Manager so that deployed API can be managed and governed centrally from API Manager. Developers should enable autodiscovery on the deployed APIs so that appropritae policies from API Manager can be downloaded and enabled on deployed API by gateway runtime.</p>
            <p>Most APIs in client environments are protected with Client ID enforcement policy, and consumers apps are onboared with a easy registration process to obtain client ID and secret and apps can make authenticated calls to the APIs. There are provisions to enable OAuth & SAML usecases with identity & authorization platforms like OKTA, AWS Congnito, Microsoft Active Directory and many more.</p>
            <p>Though eariler multiple Mule 3 Apps were deployed in a mule server with community or enterprise edition, but as we have progressed to Mule 4, Mule Deployments have mostly progressed in  worker based deployment model. CloudHub is PAAS platform that provides configurable options to choose the mule runtime and allows developers to upload the mule application as a JAR file. Behind the scene appropriate cloud infrastructure is provisioned with on-demand AWS instances, and then mule runtime and mule code is deployed on the provisioned resources. With the advent of Microservices architecture as a mainstream approach, Anypoint Platform offers Runtime Fabric that transforms the uploaded Jar file in an immutable container image and deploys it on the fabric layer that leverages the container runtime like docker and orchestration engine like Kubernetes.</p>
            <p>One of the ways we have connected monoliths in the past is by leveraging the principles of Service Oriented Architecture like Standard Contracts, Loose Coupling, Reusability & others and created services that are organized across different layers like Entity Services, Process Services, Utility Services and can be discovered by enterprise service inventory. But as quickly moved towards REST based architectures in the past decade, Mulesoft C4E advices to use API Led connectvity to create System APIs, Process APIs and Experience API that can quickly unlock the business benefits for the enterprises.</p>
            <p>Mule Applications that run on a lightweight integration engine referred as Mule Runtime connect systems, services, APIs and devices using API Led connectivity instead of point-to-point integrations. Mule Components that are the main building blocks provides features like message routing & transformation, batch processing, error handling, asynchronous calls, reusable subflows and others are categorized into core components, connectors and modules. Each mule application has an event source like scheduler, HTTP listener that produces a Mule Event which consists of attributes, payload and variables wrapped in a mule message is the core information that is processed by the runtime.</p>
            <p>Another cool part of Mule ESB is the Dataweave, the lightweight and elegant expression language,  and transform component that powers the mule data transformation engine.<br>
            <span class="tab">DataIn ----->  |Reader| --Canonical Model---> |DW Script| --Canonical Model---> |Writer|-------> Data Out</span><br>
            When DataWeave receives the data, it normalizes the incoming payload & variable references into a Canonical format that consists of dataweave simple types, arrays or objects and then renders to desired format as per the output directive.
