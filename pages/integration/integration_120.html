                        <li><strong>Testability: </strong>Ability of a service so that one can test easily and completely. Generally smaller services are testable, so as enterprises migrate from monoliths to microservices; the test coverage should increase but completeness has to addressed broadly with different groups.</li>
                        <li><strong>Predictability: </strong>Ability of a service to keep performing as the number of request increases/or decreases. Predictability also covers that the response time of the service stays within SLA. Generally Asynchronous style, though complex, provides better levers to improve this characterstic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability: </strong>Ability of a service to increase computing power (vertical) or add more instances (horizontal) with increase in number of request.</li>
                        <li><strong>Elasticity: </strong>Ability of a service to scale dynamically and this characterstic is synonymous with autoscaling in cloud.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deployability: </strong>Ability of a system to maintain service autonomy with easier and less risker releases to production qite frequently. Microservices promote deployability as a key characterstic as services are single purpose function, so deployment risk at service level is quite low but complexity/scale has to be managed with mordern tools, platforms and frameworks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extensibility: </strong>Ability of a system to minimize the changes and impact to existing services as we add new features.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agility: </strong>Ability of a system to rapidly provision resources, allow developers and deployers to use best practices, standardized templates and resusable components so that it responds to changes quickly and improves service maintainability.</li>
