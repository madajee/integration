                        <li><strong>Testability: </strong>Ability of a service so that one can test easily and completely. Generally smaller services are testable, so as enterprises migrate from monoliths to microservices; the test coverage should increase but completeness has to addressed broadly with different groups.</li>
                        <li><strong>Predictability: </strong>Ability of a service to keep performing as the number of request increases/or decreases. Predictability also covers that the response time of the service stays within SLA. Generally Asynchronous style, though complex, provides better levers to improve this characterstic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability: </strong>Ability of a service to increase computing power (vertical) or add more instances (horizontal) with increase in number of request.</li>
                        <li><strong>Elasticity: </strong>Ability of a service to scale dynamically and this characterstic is synonymous with autoscaling in cloud.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deployability: </strong>Ability of a system to maintain service autonomy with easier and less risker releases to production qite frequently. Microservices promote deployability as a key characterstic as services are single purpose function, so deployment risk at service level is quite low but complexity/scale has to be managed with mordern tools, platforms and frameworks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extensibility: </strong>Ability of a system to minimize the changes and impact to existing services as we add new features.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agility: </strong>Ability of a system to rapidly provision resources, allow developers and deployers to use best practices, standardized templates and resusable components so that it responds to changes quickly and improves service maintainability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cloud Computing (az900_1): </strong>It is a service delivery model and the offering is categorized primarily across Infrastructure, Platform and Software layers. Cloud offers certain key characterstics like scalability, elasticity, agility, fault tolerance, disaster recovery and high availability. As per the chosen model the responsibilities is shared between the customer and the cloud provider with IAAS providing the highest control and responsibility. In the IAAS model, services are provisioned for storage, computing power, networking and analytics and one can create VMs and database services using standard templates. It is a consumption based model which allows customer to pay for usage which is accouted as OpEx and have very low CapEx. Public Cloud offering provides economies of scale as providers like Azure, AWS and GCP have cloud services available across the globe managed through physical infrastruture across different geographies, regions and availability zones and provides lower cost per unit as the business scales. Region is a geographical area which contains multiple data centers connected with high throughput internet network. Availability zone is another key term which allows high availability and replication across datacenters through low latency network. Usually there are 3 data centers in an AZ and services in an AZ still remain available when one of the data center is affected. To safegaurd from disasters like flood, servcies are replicated across region through region pairs; for eg US West is paired with US East. There are 3 deployment model in cloud, public, hybrid and private and generally clients choose public cloud for greenfield apps, hybird for brownfield programs and private for specific situations that require regulatory controls.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cloud Computing (az900_2): </strong>When the service in Azure, azure resource manager (arm) creates an object which holds configuration for the service in a JSON document. All resources have 4 common attributes like name, location, type, version and service specific configuration attributes. Resources are grouped in a Resource Group and there are multiple strategies to group the azure resources with most common based on application lifecycle and others being type, location, billing, department etc. Azure resource manager provides a unified language and common interface so that resources are managed uniformly even through they are created through different tools like Portal, REST API, SDKs, Powershell and Azure CLI. Azure Virtual Machines are compute resources which can be created either using a marketplace or custom image and can be scaled using VM scale sets. Azure VMs are more suited for lift and shift scenarios. In microservices environments, docker runtime with containers are more common and implemented using services like ACI, AKS.</li>
