                <p>Earlier When I have worked in Telematics, I came to know that journey of car connectivity goes back to early nintyees. Telematics Service Providers have built applications that connect with devices installed in the vehicle, gathers telemetry data that is persisted in databases. Service providers then build telematics features, APIs, dealer services, mobile apps that are provides to customers, mostly vehicle owners, as a subscription. Internet of Things is an umbrella that includes any thing that has a connected device and generating data at regular intervals, so in telematics it can be a car with a connected device in an OBD 2 port.</p>
                <p>In past few years, public cloud providers like AWS has created an IOT platform capabilities to help service providers either complement their journey to cloud or create new offerings competitively. In telematics, I had used  data entities like device, vehicle, customer and account in middle-tier services but important thing is that device becomes part of a vehicle; customer is a vehicle owner and usually the primary driver; account gets created when vehicle is purchased and customer opts-in for the telematics services.Architectures that sustain these telematics operations is generally complex, distributed, connects many parties like OEM, Auto Dealers and has a dedicated back offices for device and data management. Some of the example telematics services are alerting drivers when speed limit is exceeded, dispatching emergency support in crisis like car accidents. Some of these services require dedicated command centers and over the air reliable networks.</p>
                <p>As I listen to podcasts, one of the things you can do to be part of Telematics and IOT transformations is to understand the IOT offerings from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP and create a picemeal prototype which can be as easy as regsitering a ESP32 device if you aspire to be test the device generation and upgrades, develop a NodeJS lambda function to log telemetry data, understand the big picture by listening to udemy trainers like Stephen Borsay, speakers in conferences like AWS ReInvent, leaders from companies who operate in this burgeoning ecosystem. One of the key capability in telematics domain is to register the device over a secure connection so that telemetry data can be collected at regular interval. AWS IoT Core in control services of AWS IOT Service offering helps you connect devices to AWS Services and other devices, secure data interactions, and process and act upon device data. Features like authentication and authorization support with latest protocols, message broker and many others are included in the offering and can complement device management systems hosted by telematics opertors.
