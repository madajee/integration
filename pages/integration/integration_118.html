                <p>Though I have worked on system transformation earlier, but leaders and their talks are mentioning that the next era belongs to digital transformation. Generally there is an organization vision that helps us understand impact on underlying business processes and systems. I also hear in talks that Digital Journey of an organization is backed by Digital Strategy and overall digital play is extremely difficult for many organizations. Digital strategy is chartered by C-Levels and defined by graduates from B-school.</p>
                <p>Teams at clients and partner organizations transforms the digital strategy into transformation programs that starts with artifacts like challenges, scoping, current state, future state and I have seen few of those in integration programs and projects. I have also observed that some of the smart analysts in the program produce gap analysis artifacts governs the driving forces and decisions on my different aspects of the programs.</p>
                <p>Most webinars, trails that I can listen and read suggest that Integration is at heart of digital strategy and there are numerous solutions that salesforce and partner orgs are delivering for customers. One of the challenge across several domains is to unify customer data. As a mule designer, the next thing may be to learn the customer 360 solution and as fintech webinar and discussion is trending, it can provide some qualitative points to this blog. Learning this solution can help with "How might we interact with customer" so the scope has to cover the domain viewpoint. Some of the common trad-offs in this learning exercise will be alloted time and underlying cost and generally covered in project budgets. Everyone reading the blog is encouraged to follow a certain variation of project style work to reap benefits of this exercise.</p>
