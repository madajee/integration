            <h3>Agile Learner</h3>
            <p>On and off I have called to work on implementations and I understood that sales--->delivery--->support is quite similar to idea--->prototype--->product. Both product and service organization are leveraging frameworks like Scrum and Kanban to develop software in a scaled manner to realize better outcomes. So if we go back to Agile Manifesto that was doctorined by 17 snowbirds who met in Utah in 2001 mentioned four values (4V) that were around customer, consultant, code and change. (4C)
            <ul>
                <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation (Customer)</li>
                <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation (Code)</li>
                <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. (Consultant)</li>
                <li>Responding to change over follwing a plan. (Change)</li>
            </ul>
            There are 12 principles of Agile that aligns with themes like Value Delivery, Business Colloboration, Team Dynamics & Culture, Retrospectives & Continuous Learning !
            </p>
            <p><strong>Agile Project Management: </strong>Entreprenuers have a vision and business & IT leaders work together towards relaization of it. Enterprises, Communities, Governments charter programs & define milestones that are sometimes quarterly, annually or decadely. Projects are initiated as engines of the large programs and executed in parallel to meet the objectives of the stakeholders. While working on several projects, I understood that there are several discussions about planning, risk mitigation, releases, product launch in the charter panel and it is expected that we should follow agile principles in  the software delivery in the project liefcycle. Agile Project Managers usually borrows traits from experienced Product Owners and Scrum Masters and executes an iterative delivery cycles that differs from waterfall approach of delivering products and platforms in sequential phases. As we deliver on each iteration, we should adapt to changing requirements, release plan & improve on estimation / design through feedback loops. Some of things like requirements, releases are fixed in waterfall model and feedbacks are mostly when we are near releases and launches. Agile approach allows us to increase velocity, mitigate risk, improve colloboration & adaptiveness to change and eventually delighted customers. In the Agile programs, the charter is usually a Roadmap which outlines how the product or solution that will develop over time. Product Owner outlines the features and epics which governs the milestones, releases, launches etc. When we drill down on epics, Product Managers use Product Requirements and Functional specifications to produce a backlog which is a priortized list of user stories. SDLC discussions usually start at a story level and as different personas huddle together on a story, the output is several tasks and dependencies among them. Weekly and Daily tracking usually happens at the story / task level. Stories fit neatly into agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban. Personas like Scrum Master / Delivery Managers are the owners of boards and the workflow that help track and manage the completion of user stories and tasks in a given timebox. Generally workflow is a sequential flow and have stpes like TO DO --> IN PROGRESS --> CODE REVIEW --> DONE.</p>
            <p><strong>Agile with Kanban: </strong>Kanban is a visual, flow based, transparent and efficient way of delivering project work without the hassle of going through ceremonies. Kanban board has list of columns in a workflow, provide visual on how many work items are their in each stage and uses WIP limits for optimizing estimates, cross-train team members , reduce idleness and encourage team members to meet quality standards. Kanban teams usually have a priortized list of work items displayed as kanban cards in a backlog. A kanban card is visual representation of item of work typicallly denoted by a sticky on a physical board. Team commits to the kanban card by pulling into the workflow, team members then move the kanban card from one stage to another based on the completion status, WIP limits, due dates, blockers etc until it is completed & done. Kanban card becomes a visual artifact that tracks a work item as it flows through the workflow and the elapsed time between the time the card is committed to the workflow and delivered to the customer is called as lead time. It is the goal of kanban team to improve continuously and decrease the lead time as much as possible.</p>
