                <h3>Agile</h3>
                <p>On and off I have called to work on implementations and I understood that sales--->delivery--->support is quite similar to idea--->prototype--->product. Both product and service organization are leveraging frameworks like Scrum and Kanban to develop software in a scaled manner to realize better outcomes. So if we go back to Agile Manifesto that was doctorined by 17 snowbirds who met in Utah in 2001 mentioned four values (4V) that were around customer, consultant, code and change. (4C)
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation (Customer)</li>
                    <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation (Code)</li>
                    <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. (Consultant)</li>
                    <li>Responding to change over follwing a plan. (Change)</li>
                </ul>
                There are 12 principles of Agile that aligns with themes like Value Delivery, Business Colloboration, Team Dynamics & Culture, Retrospectives & Continuous Learning !
                </p>
                <p><strong>Agile Project Management: </strong>Entreprenuers have a vision and business & IT leaders work together towards relaization of it. Enterprises, Communities, Governments charter programs & define milestones that are sometimes quarterly, annually or decadely. Projects are initiated as engines of the large programs and executed in parallel to meet the objectives of the stakeholders. While working on several projects, I understood that there are several discussions about planning, risk mitigation, releases, product launch in the charter panel and it is expected that we should follow agile principles in  the software delivery in the project liefcycle. Agile Project Managers usually borrows traits from experienced Product Owners and Scrum Masters and executes an iterative delivery cycles that differs from waterfall approach of delivering products and platforms in sequential phases. As we deliver on each iteration, we should adapt to changing requirements, release plan & improve on estimation / design through feedback loops. Some of things like requirements, releases are fixed in waterfall model and feedbacks are mostly when we are near releases and launches. Agile approach allows us to increase velocity, mitigate risk, improve colloboration & adaptiveness to change and eventually delighted customers. In the Agile programs, the charter is usually a Roadmap which outlines how the product or solution will develop over time. Product Owner outlines the features and epics which governs the milestones, releases, launches etc. When we drill down on epics, Product Managers use Product Requirements and Functional specifications to produce a backlog which is a priortized list of user stories. SDLC discussions usually start at a story level and as different personas huddle together on a story, the output is several tasks and dependencies among them. Weekly and Daily tracking usually happens at the story / task level. Stories fit neatly into agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban. Personas like Scrum Master / Delivery Managers are the owners of boards and the workflow that help track user stories and tasks. Generally workflow is a sequential flow and have steps like TO DO --> IN PROGRESS --> CODE REVIEW --> DONE and story is completed as per defintion of Done</p>
                <p><strong>Agile with Kanban: </strong>Kanban is a visual, flow based, transparent and efficient way of delivering project work without the hassle of going through ceremonies. Kanban board has list of columns in a workflow, provide visual on how many work items are their in each stage and uses WIP limits for optimizing estimates, cross-train team members , reduce idleness and encourage team members to meet quality standards. Kanban teams usually have a priortized list of work items displayed as kanban cards in a backlog. A kanban card is visual representation of item of work typicallly denoted by a sticky on a physical board. Team commits to the kanban card by pulling the card into the workflow, team members then move the kanban card from one stage to another based on the completion status, WIP limits, due dates, blockers etc until it is completed & done. Kanban card becomes a visual artifact that tracks a work item as it flows through the workflow and the elapsed time between the time the card is committed to the workflow and delivered to the customer is called as lead time. It is the goal of kanban team to improve continuously and decrease the lead time as much as possible.</p>
                <p><strong>Agile with Scrum: </strong>In software projects, I have realized that when there are complex problems, we have to build products & solutions that rely on frameworks. It takes quite a bit of work to learn the framework, apply the acquired knowledge to the problem, continuously develop adaptive skills and improve on it. One such agile framework that is highly recommended for Software Development & Delivery is Scrum. According to scrum guide, it is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. As solutions & products that solves complex problems and loved by their customers are developed over time, Scrum provides a sprint which is a timebox iteration usually less than a month in which user stories are implemented & delivered as increment. Increment is a concrete stepping stone towards a product goal. Scrum Events like sprint planning, daily scrum, review & retrospective pulls scrum teams to work together on estimation, design, discuss & resolve blocking issues, inspect the sprint outcome and plan future improvements in the upcoming sprints. Other than product backlog which is managed by product owner, scrum teams create a sprint backlog which is more geared towards accomplishing user stories that meets the sprint goal. Scrum Master being defined as servant leader, encourages scrum team members to promote a culture that is bound by scrum values of commitment, focus, openness, respect and courage.</p>

                <h3>DevOps</h3>
                <p>Though Agile promise to increase velocity along with customer delight, the promise can't be fulfilled until DevOps is adopted along with Agile. Agile and DevOps together require developers, testers, deployers, maintainers & operators to understand the change in organizational culture, learn new tools and processes, implement CI/CD, increase collaboration & automation. Often times, it is easier said than done as we have to break the silos, accept failure as normal occurence, increase observability and measure everything. One of the ways to achieve this is by implementing gradual change and leverage tooling & automation.</p>
                <p>Software is a big elephant that goes through a lifecycle of discovery & planning (Product, Business and Program Guys); Build & Test (Implementation & Development Guys); Deploy & Release (System Admins, Script Developers, Network and Infrastructure Experts); Monitor, Troubleshoot & Continuous Improvement (Sustainment Guys). DevOps is a change in mindset, adoption of practices and tools that enables a shift left culture and allow teams to release features frequently & predictably from git repositories to different envrionments. DevOps guys are keen observers on the repositories & its dependencies, branching and merging, automation of pipeline tasks, monitoring, fixing and reporting pipeline failures. A thing that happens after a developer makes a commit to the repository is that the build process gets triggered and devops pipeline actionize the subsequent steps and the goal is to have a successful deployment of commit in all the environments. There are few common steps of compile, test and deploy that gets executed in a pipeline with an appropriate runtime based on the codebase. A mature devops pipeline also enables security checks, blue green & canary deployment scenarios, alerts & notification mechanisms.</p>
                <p><strong>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery / Deployment: </strong>Some of the few things that I am still learning when working on projects that involved CI/CD tools are listed below but it is critical practice in DevOps initiative and involves understanding several aspects of existing delivery processes and tools in an organization.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Git Branching and Merging</li>
                        <li>Test runs and coverage criteria in the devops pipelines and the variation when deployments is automated across different environments.</li>
                        <li>Adoption of tools that creates pipelines based on docker images whether it is for build servers or build artifacts.</li>
                        <li>Adoption of build platforms that support techniques like feature flags, security scans, push button deployments, efficient rollback approaches, observability metrics.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Continuous Integration is more geared towards cloning, building and testing the changes on another machine than developer workstation by running build, test and deply commands along with appropriate test harnesses as pipeline scripts, job and artifact management with tools like Jenkins, Artifactory; monitoring status and alerting teams on failed builds. It also include deploying the generated artifacts on development and integration servers, stopping and starting the required services.</p>
                <p>Continous Delivery builds up automation in Continuous Integration, streamlines the quality gate checks as the generated artifacts goes through a release and test cycles in up stream enviornments including production or production like environment where it get validated with production traffic either through canary or blue-green approaches. Continuous Deployment is more like pushing into production environments and feature availability is managed through feature flags.</p>
                <p><strong>Testing: </strong>Product and Program Managers creates the roadmap with epics and features. Architecture and Delivery guys run planning and grooming session which produces a backlog with user stories along with milestone, launch and release timeline. User stories generally are offshoots of use cases / scenarios and map to the technical artifacts like service, modules and components. Stories are further elaborated and also include database, infrastructure and testing tasks which are sometimes less or more complex than development tasks. As developer and devops perspective starts to put some weight on the user stories, we usually see more requirements that cover the non-functional aspects and underlying impact on existing business processes and data models. Teams that have been doing agile for a while usually develop in languages and with frameworks that scaffolds test suites with basic plumbling into the development repositories. Developers are expected to run the unit tests and meet the coverage criteria before code is pushed into the repository. As the code changes are pushed to Integration environments, automation in the build pipeline should execute test runs that checks on the availability of services, validate the input and outputs, connectvity to databases & required services. At times these checks are manual as it depends on the phase of the implementation and maturity of devops automation across the organization. DevOps teams also manage and govern the rollback scenarios by enabling deployment strategies like Blue / Green or Canary while Dev/QA guys covers the acceptance tests on scenarios / usecases.</p>
