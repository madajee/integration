            <h3>Agile Learner</h3>
            <p>On and off I have called to work on implementations, I understood that sales--->delivery--->support is quite similar to idea--->prototype--->product. Both product and service organization are leveraging frameworks like Scrum and Kanban to develop software in a scaled manner to realize better outcomes. So if we go back to Agile Manifesto that was doctorined by 17 snowbirds who met in Utah in 2001 mentioned four values (4V) that were around customer, consultant, code and change. (4C)
            <ul>
                <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation (Customer)</li>
                <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation (Code)</li>
                <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. (Consultant)</li>
                <li>Responding to change over follwing a plan. (Change)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Agile Project Management: </strong>Usually Entreprenuers have a vision and business & IT leaders work together towards relaization of it. Enterprises, Communities, Governments charter programs & define milestones that are sometimes quarterly, annually or decadely. Projects are initiated as engines of the large programs and executed in parallel to meet the objectives of the stakeholders. Though I don't have PMP but while working on several projects, I understood that there are several discussions about planning, risk mitigation, releases, product launch in the charter panel and it is expected that we should follow agile principles in  the software delivery in the project teams. Agile Project Managers usually borrows traits from experienced Product Owners and Scrum Masters and executes an iterative delivery cycles that differs from waterfall approach of delivering products and platforms in sequential phases. One of think of shrinking the waterfall SDLC cycles and applying it at a phase rather at a program. It allows us to increase velocity, mitigate risk, improve colloboration & adaptiveness to change and eventually delighted customers. In the Agile programs, the charter is usually a Roadmap which outlines how the product or solution will develop over time. Product Owner outlines the features and epics which become part of the backlog and usually becomes input for the Scrum Master / Delivery Master and team. </p>
